Übersicht Bar Widget for Chunkwm

Heavily inspired by [koekeishiya's statusbar](https://github.com/koekeishiya/Statusbar), yChunkUbar is a Übersicht widget that goes along with Chunkwm.
It features a clickable list of opened windows plus some system additional info.

I use all koekeishiya's scripts slightly modified to fit my personnal needs, as I've been used his Statusbar for a while, I ended modifying and tweaking is code a bit here and there.
